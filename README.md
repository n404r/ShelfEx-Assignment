## üéØObjective

This project demonstrates:

- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Hugging Face models to power flashcard generation
- **Educational Content Processing**: Ingests textbook excerpts, lecture notes, and educational materials
- **Automatic Flashcard Generation**: Extracts relevant Q&A pairs from content
- **User Interface**: Clean, simple Streamlit UI for interaction and card management
- **Export Functionality**: Multiple export formats for compatibility with study systems

The system meets all core requirements and implements several bonus functionalities from the assignment specifications.

## üß† Core Features

### ‚úÖ Input Processing
* Accepts raw **text input** or **PDF/TXT/DOCX file uploads** as per assignment requirements
* Performs **text cleaning** and **chunking** for optimal processing of educational content
* Supports **subject detection** and **topic-based organization** for better flashcard categorization

### üÉè Flashcard Generation
* Three difficulty levels: `Easy`, `Medium`, `Hard`
* Subject-specific templates for:
  * General
  * Computer Science
  * Biology
  * Physics
* Generates **minimum of 10-15 flashcards** per input submission (meets core requirement)
* Each flashcard contains a clear question and factually correct answer
* **GPU-optimized** processing for faster generation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is easily configurable through the `config.py` file:

```python

MODEL_NAME = "google/flan-t5-large"

# front end settings
DIFFICULTY_LEVELS = ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"]
DEFAULT_DIFFICULTY = "Medium"
SUBJECTS = ["General", "Biology", "Physics", "Computer Science"]
DEFAULT_SUBJECT = "General"

# generator settings
MAX_CARDS_PER_TOPIC = 20  
MIN_CARDS_TOTAL = 10 
MAX_CHUNK_LENGTH = 1400    
BATCH_SIZE = 20           
USE_GPU = True       

# difficulty parameters
GENERATION_PARAMS = {
    "Easy": {
        "max_length": 128,
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "num_beams": 2,
        "additional_settings": {
            "min_cards": 10,
            "max_cards": 14
        }
    },
    "Medium": {
        "max_length": 186,
        "temperature": 0.8,
        "num_beams": 3,
        "additional_settings": {
            "min_cards": 10,
            "max_cards": 13
        }
    },
    "Hard": {
        "max_length": 248, 
        "temperature": 0.85, 
        "num_beams": 4,
        "additional_settings": {
            "min_cards": 10,
            "max_cards": 12
        }
    }
}

# export parameters
EXPORT_FORMATS = ["JSON", "CSV", "Anki"]
DEFAULT_EXPORT_FORMAT = "JSON"
EXPORTS_DIR = "exports"

MODEL_MAX_LENGTH = 384  # output lenght
DO_SAMPLE = True        # varied output
EARLY_STOPPING = True

CLEAR_CUDA_CACHE = True  # always for testing
MEMORY_FRACTION = 0.9 
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **Memory issues**: Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` in config.py
* **Slow generation**: Ensure GPU is being utilized properly
* **Quality issues**: Try a different difficulty level or subject
